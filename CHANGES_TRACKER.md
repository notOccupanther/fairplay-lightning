## 📝 **Change Log**

### 2025-08-26 - CSRF/Session Loop Fix
- **Issue**: App was stuck in infinite loop of CSRF token requests and session checks after authentication
- **Root Cause**: NextAuth was making excessive session checks and CSRF token requests
- **Solution**: Implemented aggressive loop prevention with rate limiting and session check counters
- **Changes**: 
  - Added `sessionCheckCount` and `lastSessionCheck` state to limit session checks
  - Limited session checks to maximum 3 times with 5-second intervals
  - Added `updateAge: 24 * 60 * 60` to NextAuth config to reduce session updates
  - Implemented debounced artist fetching to prevent rapid API calls
  - Added `debug: false` and proper secret configuration
- **Result**: Eliminated the CSRF/session loop that was causing excessive API calls

### 2025-08-26 - Loading Loop Fix
- **Issue**: App was getting stuck in a perpetual loading loop after signing in
- **Root Cause**: Complex authentication timeout logic and loading states were causing conflicts
- **Solution**: Simplified loading states by removing `authTimeout` and `pageLoaded` logic
- **Changes**: 
  - Removed problematic `useEffect` hooks for authentication timeout
  - Simplified loading state rendering to only show loading when `status === "loading"`
  - Cleaned up conditional rendering logic in main content area
- **Result**: App now loads properly after authentication without getting stuck in loops

### 2025-08-26 - Artist Onboarding & Community Features
- **New Pages**: 
  - Artist Profile Pages (`/artists/[id]`)
  - Artist Dashboard (`/artists/dashboard`) 
  - Community Page (`/community`)
- **New API**: Artist Claim endpoint (`/api/artists/claim`)
- **UI Components**: Enhanced ArtistCard with profile links
- **Navigation**: Updated Sidebar with new routes

### 2025-08-26 - Spotify Token Refresh System
- **Issue**: Spotify access tokens were expiring, causing artist loading failures
- **Solution**: Implemented automatic token refresh in NextAuth configuration
- **Changes**:
  - Modified `jwt` callback to check token expiration
  - Added `refreshAccessToken` function for Spotify token renewal
  - Enhanced error handling for specific Spotify API error codes
  - Updated session callback to include refresh token data
- **Result**: Artists now load automatically without manual re-authentication

### 2025-08-26 - Enhanced Error Handling
